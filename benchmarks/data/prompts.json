Operating primarily in infrared wavelengths, JWST can peer through cosmic dust clouds that obscured the view of earlier telescopes like Hubble. Among its most significant discoveries are galaxies that formed just 300 million years after the Big Bang, much earlier than previously thought possible. The telescope has also provided unprecedented detail about exoplanet atmospheres, detecting water vapor, carbon dioxide, and even signs of dimethyl sulfide on distant worlds. Scientists estimate JWST will continue operating for at least 20 years, far exceeding its original 5-10 year mission timeline, thanks to an efficient launch that conserved fuel.",

It groups containers into logical units called pods, which are the smallest deployable units. Pods are managed by controllers such as Deployments (for stateless apps), StatefulSets (for stateful apps), and DaemonSets (for node-level services). K8s uses a declarative configuration model where users specify desired state in YAML manifests, and the control plane continuously reconciles actual state with desired state. Key components include the API server, etcd (distributed key-value store), scheduler, and kubelet (node agent). Services provide stable networking and load balancing across pod replicas, while Ingress resources manage external HTTP/HTTPS routing.",
